## Live Demo

Visit the live demo: [Unicity Block Explorer](https://unicitynetwork.github.io/smt-explorer)

## Network Support

The explorer supports multiple blockchain networks:

- **Mainnet** - `https://gateway.mainnet.unicity.network/` (4 shards)
- **Testnet** (default) - `https://gateway.testnet2.unicity.network/` (8 shards)
- **Localhost** - `http://localhost:3000`

Shards are discovered at runtime from each gateway's `/config/shards` endpoint, so shard
counts follow the deployment rather than being hard-coded.

Switch networks using the dropdown selector in the header. Network selection is preserved in the URL.

### Supported RPC Methods

- `get_block_height` - Get current block number
- `get_block` - Retrieve block information
- `get_block_records` - Get all records in a block (v2 aggregators)
- `get_block_commitments` - Get all commitments in a block (v1 aggregators)
- `get_inclusion_proof` - Get inclusion proof for a request

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. The explorer runs entirely client-side with no server requirements.
